Team 9 Mini Project

The dataset includes information on previous customers who have flown with them. The consumers' feedback on numerous contexts and flight data has been consolidated.
The primary goal of this dataset is to estimate if a future customer will be satisfied with their service based on the details of the other parameter values.
Airlines also need to know which aspects of their services should be stressed more in order to generate more satisfied customers.
